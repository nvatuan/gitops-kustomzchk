FEATURES
- [x] kustomize upload artifact if too long
- [x] git checkout strategy flag (sparse vs shallow) - PR#2
  - Fixes cross-service kustomize dependency issues in monorepos
  - Allows services with external references to use shallow clone
- [ ] document for policy
- [ ] Rework the template a bit more
- [ ] Output the debug log when conftest step is failing, like infoing the stderr of that command.
  - Currently if conftest command fail, it will give "Error: running test: check combined: check: ..." which is not a JSON and will fail when program try to parse it.
  - Err: failed to process: failed to evaluate policy for environment prod: failed to evaluate policy warn-pdb-zero-disruption: failed to parse conftest output: invalid character 'E' looking for beginning of value
  - It's better to also print stderr of conftest here, in case our OPA Policy is wrong.

MAINTENANCE
- [ ] unit testings and coverage
- [ ] check the bug if we use `./` prefix for --manifest-path
- [ ] output json by tool gives not capitalized, while internal working using capitalized. this causes json output to not work seemlessly with gomplate cli command call

OPTIMIZATION
- [ ] parallel as much as possible with goroutine
- [ ] do profilling measure performance
- [ ] optmize github calling API esp. the Comments fetching
